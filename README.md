# Java-OOP-Project-on-Hotel-Managemet
A console object oriented programming project on Hotel Management. 

Present Project:
  A Customer can go to my Hotel and check the availability of all the rooms .
  He can select and a room for particular number of days and get it register by filling his details.
  He can also opt for other rooms if he wants .


Missing Things in this project are :
  Connecting this project to a Database, so that rooms will be not available till some particular date.
  Scanning a Id proof of customer and storing in Database.
  Taking a E-signature of the customer.
  Transferring money into banks after the customer checksout.
  Giving options for many hotels to choose.
